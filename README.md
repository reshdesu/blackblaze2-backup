### 📦 Install from Releases (Recommended)

**Windows:**
1. Download `BlackBlaze-Backup-Tool-v1.0.43.msi` from [Releases](https://github.com/reshdesu/blackblaze2-backup/releases)
2. Run the MSI installer (no admin rights required)
3. Launch from Start Menu or Desktop shortcut

**Ubuntu:**
1. Download `blackblaze-backup-tool_amd64_v1.0.43.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/reshdesu/blackblaze2-backup/releases)
2. Install with: `sudo dpkg -i blackblaze-backup-tool_amd64_v1.0.43.deb`

### 🛠️ Development Setup

**One-Line Command (Easiest)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reshdesu/blackblaze2-backup.git && cd blackblaze2-backup && uv run bb2backup
```

**Using uv (Recommended)**
```bash

git clone https://github.com/reshdesu/blackblaze2-backup.git
cd blackblaze2-backup

# Run directly with uv (installs dependencies automatically)
uv run bb2backup
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### 1. Configure Credentials

Copy the sample environment file and add your BackBlaze B2 credentials:

```bash
cp sample.env .env
# Edit .env with your actual credentials
```

**Required credentials:**
- `B2_ENDPOINT`: Your BackBlaze B2 S3 endpoint (e.g., `s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com`)
- `B2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your BackBlaze B2 application key ID
- `B2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your BackBlaze B2 application key
- `B2_REGION`: Your BackBlaze B2 region (e.g., `us-east-005`)

### 2. Get BackBlaze B2 Credentials

1. Create a BackBlaze B2 account at [backblaze.com](https://www.backblaze.com/b2-cloud-storage.html)
2. Go to "App Keys" in your B2 account
3. Create a new Application Key (not Master Key) with S3-compatible API access
4. Note your S3 endpoint URL from the Buckets page
5. Use the Application Key ID and Application Key as your credentials

## 📖 Usage

### 1. **Configure Credentials**
   - Go to the "Credentials" tab
   - Enter your BackBlaze B2 S3 endpoint, access key, secret key, and region
   - Test the connection to verify your credentials
   - Click "Save Credentials" - they'll be stored securely

### 2. **Select Folders**
   - Go to the "Folders" tab
   - Click "Add Folder" to select folders to backup
   - Choose between single bucket or multiple bucket mode
   - Configure bucket names for each folder
   - Your selections are automatically saved

### 3. **Start Backup**
   - Go to the "Backup" tab
   - Click "Start Backup" to begin the process
   - Monitor progress and status updates
   - Cancel if needed
   - Files are organized in S3 with proper folder structure

### 4. **Schedule Automatic Backups**
   - Click "Schedule Automatic Backups" button
   - Choose frequency (1min, 5min, 15min, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Set backup time (for non-hourly schedules)
   - Your schedule is automatically saved
   - **Concurrent Protection**: Scheduled backups won't interfere with manual uploads

### 5. **Background Operation**
   - When you close the app, it minimizes to system tray
   - Scheduled backups run automatically in the background
   - Right-click the tray icon for quick actions (Show Window, Start Backup, Schedule, Exit)
   - The app automatically kills older instances when starting
   - **Incremental Backups**: Only changed files are uploaded for efficiency

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Comprehensive Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests including test data creation and backup testing
uv run python tests/integration/run_tests.py
```

### Create Test Data

```bash
# Create test folder structure with various file types
uv run python tests/integration/create_test_data.py
```

### Individual Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
uv run pytest tests/test_core.py -v

# GUI tests
uv run pytest tests/test_gui.py -v

# All tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

## 🏗️ Building Executables

### Ubuntu 24.04
```bash
chmod +x build_ubuntu.sh
./build_ubuntu.sh
```

### Windows
```cmd
build_windows_clean.bat
```

**Note**: The Windows build script automatically handles PyInstaller warnings and creates a clean executable in the `dist/` directory.

## 🛠️ Development

### Using uv for Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run the application
uv run bb2backup

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Format code (automatic with pre-commit hooks)
uv run ruff format .

# Lint code (automatic with pre-commit hooks)
uv run ruff check .

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/
```

## 🔒 Security

- **Encrypted Storage**: Credentials are encrypted using Fernet encryption
- **System Keyring**: Stored securely in the system keyring
- **No Plain Text**: No credentials are stored in plain text
- **Git Protection**: `.gitignore` configured to prevent accidental secret commits
- **Input Validation**: All credential inputs are validated before saving

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Check Logs**:
  - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.blackblaze_backup\blackblaze_backup.log`
  - **Ubuntu**: `~/.blackblaze_backup/blackblaze_backup.log`
- **Permissions**: Ensure your BackBlaze B2 Application Key has necessary permissions
- **Endpoint**: Verify your S3 endpoint URL is correct
- **Disk Space**: Make sure you have sufficient disk space for temporary files
- **Network**: Check your internet connection for upload issues
- **Concurrent Backups**: If you see duplicate uploads, check that only one backup is running
- **Installation Issues**:
  - **Windows**: Try running MSI as administrator if shortcuts don't work
  - **Ubuntu**: Use `sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite` if installation conflicts occur

## ⚡ Why uv?

We use `uv` instead of traditional pip because it's:
- **10-100x faster** than pip for package installation
- **More reliable** with better dependency resolution
- **Modern** with built-in virtual environment management
- **Cross-platform** with excellent Windows and Linux support

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- BackBlaze B2 account with S3-compatible API access
- `uv` package manager (automatically installed by build scripts)

### Development Setup

For developers, we provide an automated setup script:

```bash
# Run the development setup script
./setup-dev.sh
```

This script will:
- Install pre-commit hooks
- Set up automatic code formatting
- Fix any existing formatting issues
- Ensure consistent code style

**Pre-commit hooks automatically:**
- Format code with `ruff`
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Fix end-of-file issues
- Check YAML syntax
- Prevent large files and merge conflicts

**Manual setup:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run formatting on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```
